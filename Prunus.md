## Dataset Summary 

This dataset is comprised of digitized specimen images from accessions in the plum genus (*Prunus*, Rosaceae). The accessions are housed in many herbaria and were accessed via the idigbio search portal, with a initial search criteria requiring the specimens belong to the genus *Prunus*, and have specimen image data and be georeferenced. Specific specimens were retained in the dataset if they matched species with genetic data in the publication in review ("A phylogenomic approach, combined with morphological characters gleaned via machine learning, uncovers the hybrid origin and biogeographic diversification of the plum genus").
The images associated with each specimen were downloaded from idigbio with the goal of training two key machine learning classification algorithms.

## Data Fields 

Fields conform to the Darwin Core data standard and are detailed here: https://dwc.tdwg.org. 

## Curation Rationale 

The dataset was assembled to used machine learning algorithms to investigate morphological variation detectable in the plum genus using digitized herbarium specimens. This dataset, or portions of this dataset, can be used to design additional machine learning algorithms, and connect morphological variation with genetic data from corresponding species in the genus. 

## Initial Data Collection and Normalization 

The specimens were collected by multiple collectors from multiple institutions over the past century. Most specimens were initially identified by the collector, and some have been updated with taxonomic revisions as needed.

## Who are the source language producers? 

The occurrence data were produced by humans, observed and written onto paper labels over the history of multiple institutions, and then transcribed from paper labels attached to the unmounted herbarium sheet with the specimens upon collection. 

## Annotations 

The specimen occurrence data in Darwin Core fields. 

## Annotation process 

The occurrence data were transcribed from the labels by online volunteers and a professional transcription service into Darwin Core fields. 

## Who are the annotators? 

Original collectors and identifiers were botanists and researchers from many institutions. Demographic data of transcribers is unknown.  

## Personal and Sensitive Information 

The dataset contains the names of the collectors and identifiers.  

## Social Impact of Dataset 

Digitized natural history collections have the potential to be used in diverse research applications in evolutionary biology, ecology, and climate change.  

Some site/location names could cause harm as they are insensitive or racist towards indigenous communities. 

## Discussion of Biases 

Estimates of species geographic ranges based on these data may not be complete. There are many reasons collectors may collect more frequently from some areas rather than others, including their own taxonomic interests, proximity to collections institutions, accessibility via roads, ability to acquire permits for a specific area, or for geopolitical reasons. 

The majority of specimens in this dataset originate from North America and Europe. This represents a bias in public availability of digitized specimen data.

## Other Known Limitations 

As with all natural history collections data, there is the potential that some metadata are inaccurate or inconsistent given that they have been collected and recorded over the course of the past 100 years. This dataset as presented is a snapshot in time. 

Species identifications may be inaccurate or not up-to-date based on the latest classification.  

Collector names may not be consistent across records (e.g. the same person’s name may be written differently). For women’s names, which were often historically recorded as Mrs. <spouse’s name>, only the spouse’s name may appear. 

Locality data may use historical place names that are no longer used. 

Dates may sometimes have been recorded by original collectors inconsistently or may be incomplete (no month/day information). 

## Dataset Curators 

The original accessions were curated by many curators and collection managers and others at various institutions. This digitized image dataset was curated by Richie Hodel at the National Museum of Natural History.
